# Bexlite - Simple yet Pragmatic Tech Stack

**TLDR** : A javascript tech stack that promote simple way to build fullstack app.

It's starting right after i explore a new framework called Elysiajs [https://elysiajs.com/](https://elysiajs.com/), it's a simple and fast framework to build a Backend app. Basically it's a drop-replacement for Expressjs.

I found that Elysiajs is really simple to use, with built-in typesafety. It's really handy to use.

I've been using many Framework including React and Nextjs. I wouldn't say these are best. Because sometime it's quite complicated to build with. However i love the JSX concept. I was thinking it should be a standard for Web Templating. Since it's really ease to use.
