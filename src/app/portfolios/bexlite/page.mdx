# Bexlite Tech Stack

### Background and Motivation

Let's start with the question why i create and use this tech stack. Long time ago, i was trying to build simple app with Reactjs. And it's quite painful to handling a lot of state managements, a lot of problems with hooks and many package just to work on simple app.

I feel in 2007, it was Oldie-Goldie time. We use HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript to build everything we would love.

I can understand that when we talk about maintainable codebase, yes using reactjs in the right way is good. However, we still tired to deal with useState and useEffect.

Why do need to create state for everything ? Pending State, Holding Values, and So.

I would love to write many things here. But, i would suggest you to read it here :
