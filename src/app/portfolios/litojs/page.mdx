# Litojs: A Journey into Framework Building

Since entering the JavaScript ecosystem, I've been consistently impressed by its vibrant community. It often feels as though a new package is released on npm daily, reflecting the typical JavaScript experience.

I've experimented with numerous frameworks and libraries, appreciating the unique qualities of each. Eventually, my curiosity led me to question the underlying architecture of these frameworks. Consequently, I began exploring open-source code on GitHub, seeking to understand their construction.

## The Concept

I decided to embark on building my own framework, primarily as a learning exercise rather than for production use.

The goal is to develop a **Pragmatic Framework**: a full-stack solution with an opinionated structure and comprehensive features. This is heavily inspired by Django in Python and Laravel in PHP.

## The Process

The guiding principle is to maintain simplicity without sacrificing speed, leading to the selection of Bun.js as the core runtime. While relatively new, Bun.js offers impressive JavaScript performance.

My approach favors a Server-side First methodology. Centralizing business logic simplifies application development, although I recognize the prevalence of Client-side First approaches within the JavaScript community, largely due to React.js.

Therefore, HTMX and Alpine.js were chosen as the client-side components. HTMX manages simple requests, while Alpine.js handles client-side logic.

## The Challenges

After several weeks of development, I encountered several significant challenges.

The primary challenge involved designing an effective Developer Experience (DX). This required substantial refactoring to optimize usability.

Initial considerations focused on the framework's entry point, adopting Django's approach with a WSGI application.

```ts
import { App } from "litojs";
export const app = App({
  apps: ["core"],
});
```

The intention is to support multiple apps within a single project, promoting separation of concerns, similar to Django. New apps can be easily registered or removed from the main application.

The project architecture follows a simple structure: Controllers for Business Logic, Models for Database Schema, Routers for routing, and Views for the Presentation Layer.

```bash
products
├── controller.ts
├── models.ts
├── router.ts
├── views.tsx
```

## Progress

The project is ongoing, with an estimated completion timeframe of approximately six months. Updates on the development can be found at the following locations:
