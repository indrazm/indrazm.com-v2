# Designstripe Mockups

Designstripe mockups is a project that I have been working on for a few months. It's a collection of mockups that I have created for various projects. Basicly we create the solution for designers that building mockups where in traditional way, the need to Download Photoshop and Editing 2GB file just the get the mockups.

Of course, it was super painful, so me and the CEO was having an idea to create this project. Basicly it's just like the cloud version of the traditional way to build mockups. The different is they don't need any Photoshop or downloading 2GB+ files each mockups just to playing around to get it right.

My job on this project is doing Research and Development to build the MVP.

I do everything from Scratches. Including The Components, 3D Assets, Mockup Editor and so.

## Tech Stack

- Supabase as the Database and Storage
- Nextjs as the Frontend
- Nextjs as the Admin Panel

## WIN

I have a lot of fun with this project and also i got a lot of new knowledge working on this projects. I learn a lot about HTML Canvas and WebGL. It has attracting massive amount of users and they love it.

## Challenge

The most challenging things was to create the image distortion to stamp to the mockup screen. I had to figure out how to do it. I tried couple of things. Starting to use Konva, HTML Canvas to Translate the Image, and Blending the Image, but it just doesn't work totally. I end up with creating a layer on top of the mockups.
