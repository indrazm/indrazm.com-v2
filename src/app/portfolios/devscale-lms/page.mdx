# Devscale Learning Management System

Since May 2023 i am starting a project to build an affordable software engineering bootcamp to help students to learn not only how to do code, But also how to think as programmer.

The mission is to help everyone who is interested in learning to code. And since it's growing up that we have more than 250+ students in a year, i need to build a platform to help them managing the students.

The target is to gamificating the bootcamp and it's course.

I do couple time to rebuild the platform, it's because i need to make try many tech stack to make it works. I build with Nextjs using RESTFul API, and then move to Bexlite Tech Stack using HTMX and Elysiajs, and then End up with Nextjs 15 and Server Actions.

## Tech Stack

- Nextjs Canary 15
- TursoDB - Sqlite for Productions
- Server Actions
