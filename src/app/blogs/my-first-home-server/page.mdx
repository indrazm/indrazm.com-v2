# My first homeserver

I've been obsessed with Homelab server recently, i feel that its really useful for Software Engineer. And i want to share my experience with you.

## Why

I was triggered by my twitter timeline were my folks starting use server at home, and i was thinking why ?! In my head i always thinking that server would always used for serving something to internet. That was my mental model.

However i was wrong! Yep. The core benefit of having a home server isn't necessarily about outward-facing applications (though it can be!), but rather about **control and customization within your own network.** I started to see the potential for:

- **Centralized Storage:** A place to backup my important files, photos, and videos without relying on cloud services that I don't fully control.
- **Self-Hosted Applications:** Running services n8n, my own apps.
- **Learning and Experimentation:** A safe and isolated environment to experiment with new technologies, DevOps practices, and server administration without fear of breaking anything important.
- **Data Privacy:** Taking back control of my data by storing it on my own hardware. Less reliance on big tech and more ownership of my digital life.

These reasons resonated deeply with me. As a software engineer, I valued the learning opportunities and the control over my data. The idea of creating my own little digital ecosystem was incredibly appealing.

## The Hardware

So, I decided to dive in. The first question was: what hardware should I use?

I was thinking to start with Respberry pi. Since it's low power and quite cheap. But after chit-chat with some friends they were suggesting to use minipc .

Ultimately, I bought single minipc Elitedesk HP with i5 2core 4 threads, 16GB RAM and 128GB SSD.

## The Software

With the hardware sorted, the next step was to choose the operating system and software stack. This was another rabbit hole of possibilities!

- **Operating System:** I considered a few options, including Ubuntu Server, Debian, and even Windows Server. I ultimately went with **Ubuntu Server** due to its widespread adoption, large community support, and ease of use. Plus, I was already somewhat familiar with Ubuntu from my development environment.

- **Virtualization (Optional):** I debated whether to use virtualization to run multiple services in isolated containers. Docker was the obvious choice here. While it added a layer of complexity, I decided it was worth it for the isolation and management benefits. So, I decided to install Docker.

## Challenges and Learnings

The journey wasn't without its challenges. Despite the challenges, I learned a ton along the way. I gained a much deeper understanding of server administration, networking, and containerization. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm excited to continue exploring the possibilities of my home server.
